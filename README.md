# Number Guessing Game
- Here ``Number_Guessing_Game()`` is used to perform a simple number guessing game where the system will generate a random ``number`` from 1 to 100. User need to ``guess`` a number between 1 to 100.
- For that user will get 5 chances as ``limit`` I mentioned.Computer tells if the guess number matches or it is higher or lesser than the actual number. Variable ``tries`` will increase as guessed number is wrong.If user can't guess the number then user can also play again by pressing 1 as ``n`` otherwise game can be end by pressing 0 as ``n``.
